# Group66 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning
## Project Description

As the Internet becomes more common in daily life, the rise in cyber threats underscores the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) stands as a pivotal defense tool against cyber attacks. This project aims to augment the provided
open-source IDS-ML framework through the development of a user-friendly web-based interface and backend database integration, to allow users to gather analytics on intrusion detection data and evaluate algorithm performance.

## How to Run the Project
Make sure to be in the GROUP66BACKEND directory for everything to run correctly

Database setup (SQLite Db):

    python Backend/local_db_setup.py

Run models and connect to front end:

    python Backend/interface.py
